                          WEATHER-APP
This application obtains and renders weather forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API. It is intended to be used to show how various standard application features are integrated and used together. 
The final product of this project will be an app that displays daily weather information in a simple but incisive manner.
Data used in this project is obtained from OpenWeatherMap API and the application tries to follow the terms, conditions and guidelines for use of that service.
Core Features;
    • Minute-by-minute update on present state of weather ie sunrise and sunset, rain forecasts, temperature.
    • Feedback interactivity; user should be able to give out a comment.
    • This application is intended for and can be used by a variety of users in sectors like agriculture, logistics, retail etc.
OpenWeatherMap API is used in this project to search and obtain current forecasts on rain, sunshine and temperature of global cities.

Challenges expected;
    • Incorporating feedback interactivity in a relevant and incisive manner.
    • Accuracy of the forecast data can not be  entirely authenticated by the developer.

The project requirements are envisioned to be met through;
    • The app runs on a single page (only one index.html file), using create-react-app.
    • The app incorporates data from an external API, OpenWeatherMap. 
    • Adding interactivity aspects eg an "appreciation" button or adding comments or reviews by users. 
    • The app follows good coding practices by utilizing components in a way that keeps the code well organized,  neat and svelte.
